          <h2>4. How we use your data</h2>
          <h3>4.1 Using Personal Demographic Service (PDS) to retrieve your patient record</h3>
          <p>While using this service, PDS is used to match the answers to your questions to your PDS record and in some cases to pre-populate some answers if you have used NHS login.</p>

          <h3>4.2 Using NHS login to pre-populate your personal data</h3>
          <p>It is possible to use your NHS login account to register with the 'NHS Register with a GP Surgery' service. The benefit is that the information which we hold for your NHS login account will be used to set up your ‘NHS Register with a GP Surgery’ service and save you having to provide the same information again. During the registration process, we will ask you for your permission to use the NHS login information for the 'NHS Register with a GP Surgery' registration. See <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-app/nhs-app-legal-and-cookies/">NHS login's Privacy Notice and Terms and Conditions for more information</a>.</p>

          <h3>4.3 Securely send your application to your chosen GP surgery</h3>
          <p>The data collected by this service, is securely sent to your chosen GP surgery so that they can process your application to register with them.</p>
          <p>Your chosen GP surgery will become the data controller for your application when it is securely received by them.</p>

          <h3>4.4 Service improvement, audit and troubleshooting</h3>
          <p>We look at how the service is being used to help us make it better. To do this we put small files called “analytic cookies” on to your device using a software called These cookies are optional.  The information collected includes: the type of device you used, your browser type, your operating system, the date/time you used the service and how you interacted with the service. For more information, please see our <a href="https://gp-registration.nhs.uk/gpregistration/legal/cookies">cookie policy</a>.</p>
          <p>We also store technical log data for audit and troubleshooting (bug/fix) purposes and to make improvements to the service.</p>
          <p>The personal data collected by the service will be de-identified and analysed to optimize the service and for policy developments. Information on how many people use the service and its performance will also be used to publish anonymous statistical dashboards. See log/audit data in the table below for more information.</p>
          <p>We also count how many users have Javascript disabled or use a browser which does not support javascript in order to improve the accessibility of the service.</p>

          <h3>4.5 Send you a notification to inform you that your change of GP has been successful</h3>
          <p>The ‘Demographics Notify a Patient’ service will send you a notification via NHS App, email, SMS or post to inform you that your registration has been successful and that you can now access services at your new GP practice. This will be in cases where your new GP practice has signed up to this notification service.</p>
