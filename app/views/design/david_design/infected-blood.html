      <h2>Blood transfusions</h2>
      <p>If you received a blood transfusion in the UK before 1996 there is a small chance you may have received infected blood.</p>
      <p>Blood transfusions are routinely given to patients that:</p>
      <p><ul>
        <li>have had an accident</li>
        <li>have complications during childbirth</li>
        <li>are receiving other medical treatment</li>
      </ul></p>

    <p>Your GP surgery will use this information to manage your healthcare.</p>
