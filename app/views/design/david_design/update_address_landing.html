      <h2>Changing your home address</h2>
      <p>You can change your home address by either:</p>
      <p><ul>
        <li><p><a href="https://www.nhs.uk/service-search/find-a-gp/">Registering with a GP surgery (takes about 15 minutes)</a>, or</p></li>
        <li>Choosing 'Continue'</li>
      </ul></p>

      <p>Changing your home address will update your NHS record and the address your GP surgery has for you.</p>
      <p>If you continue with this change and [NAME OF SURGERY] is not accepting registrations from outside the area they cover, you should register with a new GP surgery because:</p>
      <p><ul>
        <li>you may not be offered home visits</li>
      <li>it could affect referrals for hospital tests and treatment, or community health services</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p>You should speak to your current GP surgery about your options.</p>
