        <p>Use this service to register with a GP surgery for the first time or to change your current GP surgery.<p/> 
        <p>If you think you need medical help right now visit <a href="https://111.nhs.uk/">NHS 111 online.</a></p>
        <p>If you are already registered with a GP surgery you can access some health and prescription services using <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/gps/online-health-and-prescription-services/">NHS online services.</a></p>


        <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">What you need to do</h2>
        <p>It will take around 15 minutes to complete a registration. You will need to complete the process in one session. If you are registering more than one person make sure you give yourself enough time.</p>
        <p>If you are registering children under the age of 16 years it is important that you register yourself first.</p>
        <p>Your chosen GP surgery should register you within 2 weeks of receiving your details.</p>
  
       
        <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">Before you start</h2>
        <p>You do not need your NHS number, but it could make registration easier.</p>
        <p>We may ask you for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>details of your previous GP surgery</li>
          <li>basic health and medical information</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>The information you provide will be used to identify the correct medical records.  It will also help the GP surgery to offer relevant and appropriate healthcare services.</p>
    
        <p><a href="who-is-registering" class="nhsuk-button">Start now</a></p>
