          Register with a GP surgery: {Surgery name}
        </h1>



        <h2>Before you start</h2>
        <p>The registration process will take around 15 minutes to complete. You will need to complete the process in one session.</p>
        <p>We'll ask you for, if you have it, your:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>name and address</li>
          <li>date of birth</li>
          <li>previous GP surgery</li>
          <li>health and medical information</li>
          <li>contact details</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You can provide a temporary address or other contact address if necessary.</p>

        <p>If you are registering for a UK GP for the first time you may also need, if you have one:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)</li>
          <li>S1 form</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You do not need your NHS number but it might make the process easier.</p>

        {{ details({
          "text": "How to find your NHS number",
          "HTML": "
          <p>An NHS number is a 10 digit number, like 485 777 3456.</p>
            <p>You can find your NHS number by logging in to a GP online service or on any document the NHS has sent you, such as your:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>prescriptions</li>
                <li>test results</li>
                <li>hospital referral letters</li>
                <li>appointment letters</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Ask your GP surgery for help if you can't find your NHS number.</p>
          "
        }) }}

        <p>Your answers will help us find the correct medical records. We use these records to offer relevant and appropriate healthcare services for the person being registered.</p>
