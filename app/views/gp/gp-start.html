        <p>The Register with a GP surgery service enables you to immediately start offering new patients the ability to register with your practice online through the new NHS service, 'Register with a GP Surgery'.</p>

        <h3>What happens next</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>select the surgery you want to sign up for the service</li>
          <li>make sure you have access to a nhs.net shared mailbox, this is where patient registration details will be sent</li>
          <li>select any additional services already provided by your surgery so that they can be offered to the patient during their registration process</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Once you have signed up, you will receive a unique url web address to put on your surgery's website.</p>
