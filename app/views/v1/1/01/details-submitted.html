        <p>If you needed an organ transplant, would you have one? The NHS Organ Donor Register lets you choose whether you do or donâ€™t wish to donate your organs after your death.</p>
        <p>It only takes 2 minutes, but if you register to donate, you might save lives in the future.</p>

        {{ actionLink({
          "text": "Register your blood and organ donation decision",
          "href": "#"
        }) }}
