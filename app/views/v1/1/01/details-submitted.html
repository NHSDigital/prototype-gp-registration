        <p>On 20 May 2020, the law around organ donation in England was changed to allow more people to save more lives. It will be considered that you agree to become an organ donor when you die, if:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            you are over 18;
          </li>
          <li>
            you have not opted out;
          </li>
          <li>
            you are not in an <a href="#">excluded group</a>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          You still have a choice whether or not you want to become an organ donor, and can register or amend your decision at any time. Follow the link below for more information.
        </p>

        {{ actionLink({
          "text": "Register your blood and organ donation decision",
          "href": "#"
        }) }}
