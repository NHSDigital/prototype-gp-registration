          <h2>4. How we use your data</h2>
          <h3>4.1 Using Personal Demographic Service (PDS) to retrieve and update your PDS record</h3>
          <p>We use the demographic data you provide to match you to your PDS record. This helps us to find your NHS number so that we can send this to your chosen GP surgery along with your application.  If you provide new contact information such as a new phone number or email address, we use this to update your PDS record.  It is important for the PDS to hold up to date contact information, so that the NHS can contact you to provide you with care e.g. send you appointment reminders and invites to health screening services.</p>

          <h3>4.2 Using NHS login to pre-populate your personal data</h3>
          <p>It is possible to use your NHS login account to register with the 'NHS Register with a GP Surgery' service. The benefit is that the information which we hold for your NHS login account will be used to set up your ‘NHS Register with a GP Surgery’ service and save you having to provide the same information again. During the registration process, we will ask you for your permission to use the NHS login information for the 'NHS Register with a GP Surgery' registration. See <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-app/nhs-app-legal-and-cookies/">NHS login's Privacy Notice and Terms and Conditions for more information</a>.</p>

          <h3>4.3 Securely send your application to your chosen GP surgery</h3>
          <p>The data collected by this service, is securely sent to your chosen GP surgery so that they can process your application to register with them.</p>
          <p>Your chosen GP surgery will become the data controller for your application when it is securely received by them.</p>
          <p>After you have submitted your registration application at the end of the Register with a GP Surgery service, your chosen GP surgery may want to ask you some additional questions. If you click the link to answer these additional questions, you will be taken to your chosen GP surgery’s website. The only information we share to the GP surgery’s website is a unique reference number associated with your application. This will allow your chosen GP surgery to link your registration application to any additional questions you answer.</p>

          <h3>4.4 Service improvement, audit and troubleshooting</h3>
          <p>We look at how the service is being used to help us make it better. To do this we put small files called “analytic cookies” on to your device using a software called These cookies are optional.  The information collected includes: the type of device you used, your browser type, your operating system, the date/time you used the service and how you interacted with the service. For more information, please see our <a href="https://gp-registration.nhs.uk/gpregistration/legal/cookies">cookie policy</a>.</p>
          <p>We also store technical log data for audit and troubleshooting (bug/fix) purposes and to make improvements to the service.</p>
          <p>The personal data collected by the service will be de-identified and analysed to optimize the service and for policy developments. Information on how many people use the service and its performance will also be used to publish anonymous statistical dashboards. See log/audit data in the table below for more information.</p>
          <p>We also count how many users have Javascript disabled or use a browser which does not support javascript in order to improve the accessibility of the service.</p>

          <h3>4.5 Send you notifications about your GP application </h3>
          <p>If you provide an email address when using Register with a GP surgery online, the service will send you an email notification to confirm that your application has been submitted to your chosen GP surgery.</p>
          <p>The service may also send you a notification via the NHS App, email, SMS and post to inform you if your registration is accepted by your chosen GP. This will only be in cases when your new GP practice has enabled this feature in the service.</p>
          <p>Your chosen GP may also send you a notification to let you know if your application is accepted or rejected.</p>
