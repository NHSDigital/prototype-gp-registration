                <p>An S1 certificate is a document issued by an EU country or Switzerland which shows that you are entitled to healthcare in the UK paid for by that country. You may be eligible for an S1 certificate if you have worked in the European Economic Area or receive benefits from abroad.</p>
                <p>If you have worked in or are paid benefits (including a state pension) by a country in the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland, that country may be responsible for paying for the cost of your healthcare under international agreements. This may also be the case if you are a posted or frontier worker employed in the EEA or Switzerland but living in the UK.</p>
                <p>The country may have issued you with an S1 certificate which needs to be registered in the UK or you may be eligible to request one.</p>
                <p>If you are currently paying the Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS) but are eligible for an S1, you may be entitled to a reimbursement of the IHS following registration of the form.</p>
