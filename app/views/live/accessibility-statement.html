          <p>This accessibility statement applies to the NHS' Register with a GP Surgery digital service for England.

          <p>We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. This means you should be able to:</p>

          
        <ul>
          <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts using browser functionality</li>
      
          <li>zoom in up to 400 per cent without the text spilling off the screen</li>
      
          <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
      
          <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
        
          <li>Interact with most of the website using a screen reader (including recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We also try to make the website text as simple as possible to understand.</p>

          <h2>How accessible this website is</h2>
          <p>We know from an accessibility reports that parts of this website are not fully accessible. Various accessibility and usability issues were reported by automated testing tools and manual user testing. Numerous access issues were reported by users who require audio feedback to navigate and interact with page content.
          </p>
          <p>For example:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Some page elements either did not contain discernible text or were not descriptive enough for users to determine their function or purpose.</li>
          
            <li>Some pages are difficult to navigate due to multiple generic page titles and non-sequential heading structures.</li>
          
            <li>Users are not warned of the duration in which inactivity will result in their session expiring and users are not given the opportunity to extend their session before it expires.</li>
          
            <li>Some of the colour combinations found on the site are low contrast and are likely to be difficult for people with low vision to read.</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <p>We cannot guarantee that all accessibility issues have been identified. The issues reported are examples of any assistive technology barriers which were encountered during accessibility testing. Information has been provided detailing how to resolve them. The test does not list each specific area that requires change but highlights patterns of problems where they exist. Additional instances of these barriers may exist in other pages of the service, wherever these barriers are present, they will also need to be resolved.</p>
         
          <p>We are actively working to address these issues as part of an ongoing programme to improve the accessibility of this website.</p>
         
          <h3>Feedback and contact information</h3>
          <p>We are always looking to improve the accessibility of this website. <a href="https://gp-registration.nhs.uk/20211208/gpregistration/feedback">Give us feedback</a> if you have an accessibility query including:</p>
          <ul>

          <h3>What we're doing to improve accessibility</h3>
         
          <p>We have published tools and guidance on accessibility in the <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/">NHS digital service manual</a> based on extensive testing. The service manual helps our teams build products and services to meet the same accessibility standards.</p>
   
          <p>At NHS Digital, creating an accessible service is a team effort. We want our teams to make accessible services by:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>considering accessibility at the start of their project, and throughout</li>
            <li>making accessibility the whole team's responsibility</li>
            <li>researching with disabled users</li>
            <li>using a library of accessible components and patterns</li>
            <li>carrying out regular accessibility audits and testing</li>
            <li>designing and building to level AA of WCAG 2.1 â€“ which is NHS Digital policy</li>
          </ul>

          <p>As part of this commitment, we have set up a cross-functional accessibility working group to make sure that accessibility remains at the core of everything we do.
          </p>

          <p>We are making sure that accessibility issues highlighted in this statement are being prioritised and fixed.</p>

          <h4>Preparation of this accessibility statement</h4>
          <p>This statement was updated in September 2022.</p>
          <p>This website was tested in July 2022 by the <a href="https://digitalaccessibilitycentre.org/">Digital Accessibility Centre (DAC)</a> who performed an expert evaluation of the service against all level A and AA success criteria of WCAG 2.1. Content was selected to make sure a good representation of different pages, templates and components were tested as well as key content and user journeys.</p>
