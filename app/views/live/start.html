        <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">Before you start</h2>
        <p>The registration process will take around 15 minutes to complete. You will need to complete the process in one session. You do not need your NHS number, but it could make registration easier.</p>
        <p>We may ask you for:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>details of previous GP surgery</li>
          <li>basic health and medical information</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The information you provide will be used to identify the correct medical records.  It will also help the GP surgery to offer relevant and appropriate healthcare services.</p>

        <p><a href="who-is-registering" class="nhsuk-button">Start now</a></p>
