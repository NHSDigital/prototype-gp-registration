            <h3>What happens next</h3>
            <p>Your registration details will be sent to chosen GP so they can register you. You do not need to do anything else. Your health records will be transferred to your new GP surgery.</p>
            <p>The time this takes varies between GP surgeries, usually no longer than 2 weeks.</p>
            <p>If you need an appointment before then you can contact the practice to make one.</p>
