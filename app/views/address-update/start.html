      <p>You can change your home address by either:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="find-gp-is-address-uk">Find and register with a GP surgery</a> that covers your new address (takes about 15 minutes), or</li>
        <li>Choosing to continue</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Changing your home address will update your NHS record and the address your GP surgery has for you.</p>
      <p>Some GP surgeries will only accept patients that live within the area they cover. This is called their catchment area.</p>
      <p>If you continue with this change and Lordship Lane surgery is not accepting registrations from outside their catchment area:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>you may not be offered home visits</li>
        <li>it could affect referrals for hospital tests and treatment, or community health services</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You should speak to your current GP surgery about your options.</p>
