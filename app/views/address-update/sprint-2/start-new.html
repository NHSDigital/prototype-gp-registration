      <p>Your current GP surgery may contact you to confirm you've moved outside of their catchment area. You might:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>stay with your current surgery, but with some changes to the care you get</li>
        <li>have to find a new GP surgery</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This is because your current GP might not be the right place for you to get care if your address has changed.</p>

      <p>If your current surgery doesn't accept patients outside of their catchment area, you will have 30 days to find a new GP to register with.</p>
