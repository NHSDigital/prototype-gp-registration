<h3>Compliance status</h3>

<p>This website is fully compliant with the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.1</a> AA standard.</p>

<h2>Content that's not within the scope of the accessibility regulations</h2>

<p>Areas of the service which fail to meet the WCAG 2.1 AAA requirements, but are not within the scope of the accessibility regulations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Links are present that do not indicate that they will open in a new browser window.</li>
  <li>Some text content difficult to read due to the colour contrast of foreground and background colours.</li>
  <li>Acronyms are present that are not expanded in their first instance.</li>
  <li>Multiple generic links are present that are not descriptive out of context.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What we're doing to improve accessibility</h2>

<p>We have published tools and guidance on accessibility in the <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/">NHS digital service manual</a> based on extensive testing. The service manual helps our teams build products and services to meet the same accessibility standards.</p>

<p>At NHS England, creating an accessible service is a team effort. We want our teams to make accessible services by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>considering accessibility at the start of their project, and throughout</li>
  <li>making accessibility the whole team's responsibility</li>
  <li>researching with disabled users</li>
  <li>using a library of accessible components and patterns</li>
  <li>carrying out regular accessibility audits and testing</li>
  <li>designing and building to level AA of WCAG 2.1 â€“ which is NHS Digital policy</li>
</ul>

<p>As part of this commitment, we have set up a cross-functional accessibility working group to make sure that accessibility remains at the core of everything we do.</p>

<p>We are making sure that accessibility issues highlighted in this statement are being prioritised and fixed.</p>

<h3>Preparation of this accessibility statement</h3>

<p>This website was tested in April 2025 by Dig Inclusion who performed an expert evaluation of the service against all level A and AA success criteria of WCAG 2.1.</p>

<p>Content was selected to make sure a good representation of different pages, templates and components were tested as well as key content and user journeys.</p>
