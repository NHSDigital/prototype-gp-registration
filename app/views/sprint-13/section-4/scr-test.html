This additional information has details of any significant illnesses and health problems, operations and vaccinations you have had, how you would like to be treated (such as where you would prefer to receive care), what support you might need and who should be contacted for more information about you. Your SCR can only be shared with healthcare staff treating you and provides them with vital information from your health record.</p>
