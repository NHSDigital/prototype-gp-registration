<p>Do NOT use this service if you need:</p>
<ul>
  <li>medical help right now. Instead visit <a href="https://111.nhs.uk/">NHS 111 online.</a></li>
  <li>an urgent appointment. Instead you should contact your current GP using <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/service-search/find-a-gp/">Find a GP.</a></li>

          <p>If you are already registered with a GP surgery you can access some health and prescription services using <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/gps/online-health-and-prescription-services/">NHS online services.</a></p>
          
                
        <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">Before you start</h2>
        <p>If you have your NHS number it could make it easier to register.  <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/online-services/find-nhs-number/">Find your NHS number.</a></p>
        <p>We may ask you for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>details of your previous GP surgery</li>
          <li>basic health and medical information</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>The information you provide will be used to identify the correct medical records.  It will also help the GP surgery to offer relevant and appropriate healthcare services.</p>
    
        <p><a href="who-is-registering" class="nhsuk-button">Start now</a></p>
    
                  <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">How long it takes</h2>
          <p>It takes around 15 minutes to complete a registration. You need to complete the process in one session. Your preferred GP surgery should register you within 1 working day of receiving your details.</p>
            <p>If you are registering more than one person make sure to give yourself enough time.</p> 
                 
          <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">If you are registering more than one person</h2>
          <p>For multiple or family registrations you need to complete a registration for each person before submitting them all at once.</p> 
          <p>If you are registering children aged 15 years and under it is important that you register yourself first.</p>
        
        <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Other ways to register</h2>
